# Larger project 1 in Tölvugrafík (Computer graphics)

The classic game Pong played against yourself. You control both paddles but they move in opposite directions.  
The ball starts out in a random spot and with a random direction to move.  
Points appear regularly and collecting them increases the speed of the ball.  
The game is made with WebGL.
